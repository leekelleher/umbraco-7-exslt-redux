# EXSLT Redux

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

EXSLT resurrected for Umbraco 7.x


### Background

With the release of Umbraco 7, the previously built-in EXSLT extension methods have been removed.  The reason for this is [explained on ticket #U4-2742](http://issues.umbraco.org/issue/U4-2742#comment=67-9450). (*In a nutshell the many of the EXSLT extension methods haven't worked since Umbraco 4.5 / .NET 4.0.*)

However since there are still other EXSLT extension methods that work, there has been a demand for continued support. Thus this package was created.


### Installation

This package is one of those "install and forget" packages, as in there is no configuration or set-up required.

To install the Umbraco package, here are the steps:

1. [Download the package from the Our Umbraco website.](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/exslt-redux)
2. Login to your Umbraco back-office.
3. Go to the *Developer* section.
4. From the tree, expand the *Packages* folder.
5. Select *Install local package*.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions.
